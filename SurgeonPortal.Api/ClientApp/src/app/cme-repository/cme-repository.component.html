      CME requirements for the <i>Continuous Certification (CC) Program</i> are
      <b>150 category 1 CME credits</b> earned over the last five calendar
      years, <b>50 of which must be self-assesment credits</b>. Note that ABS
      will waive 25 category 1 credits and 50 self-assessment credits for each
      successfully completed Continuous Certification Assessment (CCA). If you
      are current with your CCA's, you will meet the self-assessment requirement
      for the entire five-year period, and, depending upon your CCA cycle, you
      will reduce the category 1 requirement by 50 to 75 credits. If you are not
      yet enrolled in the CC program, averaging 30 CME credits per year will
      help you stay on track with this requirement.

            * Credits and ABS Waivers dropping off are those that were earned
            more than five years ago from today. You may see an increase in the
            number of credits needed the next time you login if you have CME
            that is expiring between now and the end of the year. Refer to the
            itemized CME section for specific CME activities that may drop off
            soon.
